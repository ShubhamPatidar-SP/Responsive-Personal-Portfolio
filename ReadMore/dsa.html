                <h2 class="sub-heading">Background in data structure</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a dedicated student at Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT) Bhopal, where my
                    passion lies in mastering data structures and algorithms. Through rigorous study and practice, I
                    have achieved proficiency in these essential elements of computer science. In this description, I
                    will delve into my journey as a student, highlighting my commitment to continuous learning and
                    problem-solving. </p>
                <h2 class="sub-heading">Expertise in Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a track record of solving more than 750+ problems
                    related to data structures and algorithms on different prominent platforms like GeekforGeeks,
                    LeetCode, and Codeforces. This extensive hands-on experience has not only reinforced my theoretical
                    knowledge but also honed my practical problem-solving skills. It has allowed me to apply what I've
                    learned in real-world coding challenges, further deepening my expertise in this critical area of
                    computer science.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sub-heading">C++ Programming and Application of OOP's</h2>
                <p>
                    My programming language of choice is C++, and I've developed a deep understanding of its syntax and
                    features. Additionally, I am well-versed in leveraging the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to
                    write optimized and modular code. This proficiency has enhanced my ability to craft elegant and
                    maintainable software solutions. I've embraced the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP)
                    in my coding practices. This approach allows me to create software solutions that are not only
                    efficient but also structured in a way that promotes reusability and adaptability.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sub-heading">Efficiency, Scalability, and Lifelong Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Efficiency is a fundamental aspect of my problem-solving approach, where I focus on crafting code
                    that operates seamlessly and meets performance standards. Furthermore, I incorporate scalability
                    considerations into my projects, ensuring their adaptability to evolving requirements. As a
                    dedicated student, I recognize the significance of staying current in the swiftly evolving field of
                    computer science. I am deeply committed to continuous learning and consistently engage in
                    self-improvement efforts, ensuring that I remain equipped with the latest knowledge and tools to
                    excel in my studies and future career pursuits.
